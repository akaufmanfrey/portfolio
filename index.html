        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Adam Kaufman-Frey. Originally, I studied physics and math in my undergrad and worked one summer 
            as a research student at TRIUMF, a particle accelerator in Vancouver. After this, I decided I wasn't interested in 
            academia and started looking for other pursuits. During my undergrad, I had taken some computer science courses 
            and had done some coding in physics courses as well. My job at TRIUMF was doing data analysis in python and matlab
            so I had some experience coding. <br> <br>

            These experiences showed me that coding involves similar logic and problem solving skills to math and this is how I
            first became interested in web development. Since then I have enrolled in a web dev bootcamp with edX through the
            University of Toronto. I've also enjoyed solving leetcode problems on the side as a way to scratch my problem solving
            itch.
